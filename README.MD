This is the main github page for my account. All folders present inside are other folders which are called "projects".

For eg., an index.html file will be served if you visit https://sabarigr.github.io/ and jekyll-theme will be served if you visit https://sabarigr.github.io/jekyll-theme

*Note:* _jekyll-theme_ is a separate repository

To use a repository as part of github pages, commit it to *gh-pages* branch.
