We, a group of employees from Object Frontier software pvt ltd, would like to participate in your turtle walk drive which has, I guess, already begun. It is mentioned in your website that a fee of Rs. 150 per person is accepted as a donation. Kindly let us know if this mandatory as we need to inform our employees prior to joining the program.

Thank you and we highly appreciate your efforts towards environmental conservation.
